# Notice Board Application using Spring, Thymeleaf and Hibernate

# About

The project is a notice board application that lets users with accounts login and create, edit, or delete a post or comment and lets anonymous users only
view the posts or comments. 

The application is made using Spring, Thymeleaf and JavaScript for the frontend, Hibernate and Postgresql for the backend, and Spring Security for the 
user authentication.

Visit the site through: https://noticeboardapplication.herokuapp.com/

* all the backend, api, urls work with postman but unfortunately the frontend part does not work as it is intended to.
